        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Gabriela Sanchez and I am from the Watts area here in Los Angeles, California. I have attended schools near my area my whole life. Therefore, I went to Compton Elementary, Markham Middle School where I was placed in the magnet program and King Drew Magnet High School. I did not know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I know we are often asked so that we can try to have our future planned ahead of us. However, I could not pick a career goal at such a young age. I remember my answers were often "a doctor" or "a psychiatrist" and sometimes I even thought "how about a materials engineer?". Was I ever completely aware of what these careers were? Never. However, there was one thing I did manage to notice at such a young age. I always chose something in STEM. Every time I was asked that question, my answer was always related to STEM. I slowly started to notice how much I preffered math and science over humanties courses. That was reflected in my school work as well. I did not do my best in English when it came to standardized testing but my math score was always high. Little did I know that these things would lead me to where I am today.  <br><br>

        Most of my accomplishments were achieved throughout my high school career. In high school, I developed a interest in research because of a volunteer program that allowed me to work in a professional lab during my junior year. I had the opportunity to learn real lab procedures at Charles Drew University which was very interesting and fun for me. This led me to continue pursuing research. I applied for a research internship the following summer at Charles Drew University where I shadowed a pharmacist and created my own research project. This program taught me how to make research posters. The next summer, I applied to a similar internship however, I went on all paid trip to Bethesda, Maryland to present my research at the National Institute of Health. High school brought me many great opportunities and it also put me on my career path. I still had a strong interest in STEM while I was in high school. I recall taking difficult courses such as AP Physics and AP Calculus. High school was when I liked to challenge myself so that I can push myself to be better in college.<br><br>

        My whole life I knew I wanted to go to college. Seeing how my parents made sacrifices to give me a better future motivated me to go to college. My interest in research motivated me even more to go to college because I knew I would have plenty of opportunities to continue puruing research on campus. I was unsure of where I wanted to go but when I toured the UCR campus I was able to imagine myself as a successful student attending the school. College is definitely different from what I am used to and it is more difficult considering the circumstances we are under but nothing is stopping me from succeeding.
